### 🚀 OVERVIEW

<div align="justify">

**Equity Depot** is a production-style data engineering project that ingests, transforms raw financial APIs into a structured data, standardizes and stores fundamental equity data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Yahoo Finance into a **query-optimized relational database**.

The system is designed to serve as a **robust data backbone** for scalable financial analytics, screening engines, and BI applications.

---

### 🎯 PROJECT PURPOSE

This project focuses on building the **foundational data layer** required for institutional-grade equity analytics systems. Instead of jumping directly to dashboards, Equity Depot emphasizes:

- Reliable data ingestion
- Clean standardization
- Efficient storage design
- Downstream analytics readiness

Think of it as the **data warehouse layer for equity fundamentals**.

---

### 💼 BUSINESS PROBLEM

Raw financial data obtained from public APIs is typically:

- Semi-structured
- Inconsistent across companies
- Not analytics-ready
- Poorly organized for SQL-based querying

Meanwhile, analysts and BI developers require:

- Standardized schemas
- Clean financial metrics
- Query-efficient storage
- Reproducible data ingestion workflows

**Equity Depot** addresses this gap by transforming API-level financial data into a **structured relational warehouse optimized for analytics consumption**.

---

### 🎯 PROJECT OBJECTIVE

To design and implement a **reproducible data pipeline** that:

- Extracts financial data for NSE-listed companies
- Standardizes and normalizes key financial attributes
- Stores structured datasets in SQLite
- Enables scalable SQL-based analytics
- Serves as a foundation layer for advanced scoring engines and BI dashboards

---

### 📊 DATA SOURCES

**Primary Sources**

- National Stock Exchange (NSE)
- Yahoo Finance API

**Data Coverage**

The pipeline ingests and structures the following datasets:

- NSE listed stocks universe
- Company static information
  - Sector
  - Industry
  - Company name
  - Business summary
- Company dynamic information
  - Price
  - Market capitalization
  - Employee count
  - OHLC data
- Financial statements metadata
  - Balance Sheet
  - Income Statement
  - Cash Flow Statement

### 🗄️ DATABASE DESIGN

The project implements a **normalized relational schema** covering:

- Equity universe metadata
- Company profile attributes
- Market metrics
- Ownership structure
- Financial statement reference fields

**Schema Capabilities**

The database is designed to support:

- Efficient filtering by sector and industry
- Aggregation across key financial attributes
- Seamless integration with BI tools
- Downstream scoring logic (Phase 2)

---

### ⚙️ AUTOMATION LAYER

Python-based ingestion scripts are designed to:

- Fetch data programmatically from external APIs
- Standardize column structures across companies
- Handle missing and inconsistent values
- Persist normalized datasets into SQLite
- Allow scalable expansion of the equity universe

The ingestion workflow is built to be **reproducible, modular, and extensible**, aligning with real-world analytics engineering practices.

---

- Top companies by market capitalization within each sector
- Ownership distribution across industries
- Sector-wise equity universe distribution
- Filtering by float shares and insider holdings
- Price-to-fundamental screening

**Downstream Use Cases**

This foundation enables a reusable financial data layer for:

- BI dashboards

git clone https://github.com/vishnuvardhanaan/equity-fundamental-engine.git
cd equity-fundamental-engine
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python -m scripts.run_pipeline

# or

python scripts/run_pipeline.py

```

1. After opening application, select **Stock List** first
2. Then click Run
3. Monitor progress via logs and UI status

---

### 🧭 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

This project intentionally separates concerns across the analytics stack:

- **Data Engineering** — Equity Depot (current project)
- **Analytics & Scoring** — Next phase
- **Visualization & BI Deployment** — Next phase

This modular architecture mirrors real-world production systems where:

- Data layers are decoupled from analytics layers
- Transformations are fully reproducible
- Storage is schema-controlled and governed
- Downstream logic builds on stable data foundations

---

### 🧩 ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM

The database is structured using a modular relational design where each domain (profile, market metrics, ownership) is separated and linked through a common equity identifier (`symbol`).

![ER Diagram](<Equity Depot ER Diagram.png>)

This structure enables:

- Domain-level isolation
- Query optimization
- Downstream feature engineering
- Future extensibility for scoring engines

---

### 🌍 WHY THIS MATTERS

Financial analytics systems are only as strong as their underlying data foundations.

In real-world finance teams:

- Raw API data is unreliable for direct analytical use
- Inconsistent schemas reduce analytical efficiency
- Lack of normalization limits BI scalability
- Poor structuring increases model fragility

**Equity Depot demonstrates how to:**

- Design structured financial data layers
- Normalize heterogeneous API outputs
- Prepare relational schemas for SQL-based analytics
- Build reusable financial datasets for downstream modeling

This project reflects how financial institutions and analytics teams architect data pipelines **before** applying scoring, modeling, or visualization layers.

---
